# ILRI-ZEBU-APP

The overall goal of this project was to create an improved platform compared to the old existing
system using a mobile application to automate the Zebu Club's services to help members integrate
better with their daily activities. The proposed application development will assist members in
getting up-to-date information with the latest announcements, events, and activities regarding 
the club's environment on their personal handheld smart mobile devices. A centralized application 
that monitors, manages, and maintains their membership experience on campus, 
such as notfying users for announcements, providing daily food menus and pizza ordering feature, 
easy access to booking services such as the swimming pool, gym sessions, and tennis/squash and basketball courts and giving feedback to these services.
